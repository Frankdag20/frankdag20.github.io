                <h2 class="my-4"><small>Abstract</small> </h2>

                <p class="lead">Barnegat Bay is a key lagoonal back-barrier estuarine system that plays a large role in the economic activity and ecosystem of the New Jersey coast. As the largest body of water in New Jersey, over half a million people affect it annually
                    through nutrient pollution and runoff. In order to further understand the anthropogenic impact, many studies have been conducted to model the bay. Despite these models giving researchers an idea of the different properties of a bay
                    system, they do not take advantage of computational advancements that have occurred in recent years or account for changing parameters, such as sea level rise. The SCHISM open-source program has several libraries in order to model
                    the hydrodynamics of water, taking into account wind, the Coriolis effect, baroclinic differences, and depth. Utilizing this model and bathymetric data, a current model of Barnegat Bay was formulated. The study suggests that poor circulation
                    in the northern part of the bay is a result of the decreased outflow from urbanization, providing evidence that increased eutrophication in the northern bay could be a result from the poor circulation in that area. The mathematical
                    utilized to analyze these relationships can be applied to other key bodies of water.</p>

                <p class="lead">In order to create the model, 32,678 elevation data points across the Barnegat Bay were collected by the United States Geological Survey. The data can be seen here as a raster plot, contour plot, and bathymetry plot.</p>

                <p class="lead">In order to evaluate the simulation, the area and shape of Barnegat Bay had to be defined. However, mathematically there is no easy way to define such irregular shapes without being computationally intensive. Therefore, a Delaunay triangulation
                    algorithm was implemented in order to define the area using a tessellation of triangles. There are several methods to applying a Delaunay triangulation, but the most computationally efficient is the divide and conquer approach. It
                    runs in a O(Nlog N) time, and therefore works best for this study (Lee & Schacter, 1980). Using SMS by Aquaveo, a GIS map projection of Barnegat Bay was placed onto the interface. Then, a series of feature arcs were generated, encompassing
                    the part of the bay that had data present. An arc represents a conceptual model of a feature in the system. In this case, the arc represents the shoreline for the entire bay. Once the feature arcs were produced encompassing the bay,
                    a Spline fit algorithm was performed in order to smooth out the perimeter of the feature arc connections. This adds more realism to the model and removes the sharp edges that were originally present (Lange, 1986).
                </p>
                <p class="lead">Once a smooth curve was generated around Barnegat Bay in SMS, the Delaunay triangulation had to be performed. For three points A, B, and C, they are connected by a circle circumscribing a triangle inside. The algorithm must determine if
                    point D is inside the circle. After determining the determinant, if the value is greater than 0, then it can be concluded that the point lies within the circle (Figure 3). The matrixes for points A, B, C, and D is defined by the following:

                    </center>
                <p class="lead">The divide and conquer method for finding Delaunay triangles uses random distributions to choose vertices and generates the two possible triangles that can be made from them (Lee & Schacter, 1980). It then checks which one is a Delaunay triangle and which
                    one is not, and chooses the former to be utilized.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">This was implemented into SMS, which generated the triangulated mesh of Barnegat Bay. However, in order to add the depth and 3-dimensionality to the mesh, it had to be interpolated to the elevation data gathered. The data was imported
                    and contained an x, y, and z coordinate for each elevation value. The mesh was then interpolated, where each data value in the triangles were averaged in order to be assigned to the node where the triangles intersected. A visual representation
                    of the mesh and interpolation was generated.
